# SingletonPattern

 Singleton is a design pattern that is very popular in development. Most of the developers are using this design pattern. This is very simple, common and easy to use in your project. It initializes your class instance single time only with static property and it will share your class instance globally.


// Usage: 

    LocationManager.shared.requestForLocation()
    print(LocationManager.shared.locationGranted)
